How do you make tea? Simple ,
        put a teaspoon of tea into a boiling
cup of water. Strain




        the water , pour some milk and sugar to taste
the tea is ready! Interestingly ,
        everything that we prepare has
        lea recipe and is made up of

        simpler ingredients.
    yle\n\nFor example , what is sugar made of? It is made of sugar
        l , which in
        turn, are made up of atoms.
        The atom is the

leThe molecule is the smallest part

        of a substance known as a
 one atom of carbon , it forms carbon dioxide gas.

yle\n\nIs there a recipe for the atom? Yes! As with every other
